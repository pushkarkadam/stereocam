Camera Calibration for Stereo Zed Camera using OpenCV
=====================================================

This is a small project that focus on using OpenCV in python to calibrate stereo camera.

The camera used for Calibration is the stereo Zed 2i camera.

The calibration process provides the intrinsic and extrinsic matrices of the camera that is used in depth estimation.

The project also reads the data from stereo camera, and performs depth and disparity estimation.
